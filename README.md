# Project-2
Gabriel Gil
Website with a Search Engine Project for QuickStart - Florida Atlantic University
The purpose of this project is to incorporate a Giphy search engine, permitting users to enter keywords and submit to Giphy's API to display a grid of images for their use; the site is to be responsive for both desktop and mobile devices.
Technologies Used (.html, .css, .js, Bootstrap, jQuery, AJAX, Giphy API)
Ideas for future improvment:
1.) Incorporate additional API request parameters to offer further search options to the user such as filtering age appropriate results or searching for a specific GIPHY user.
2.) While optional, SCSS may be a good means of neatly writing and implementing designs that may not be part of the Bootstrap's framework.
3.) Experiment with other open-source CSS frameworks like Tailwind that may better design the website's layout and style.
